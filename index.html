<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  I am a sophomore at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in Supply Chain Management with a certificate in Business and Public Policy. Growing up in Houston, I lived with my parents, my older brother (and now my sister in law), and grandparents. My dad's side lives in Houston, so I hangout with my cousins often as well. My family and friends mean everything to me, and I love spending time with them. I also enjoy traveling to new countries and learning about other people's cultures! I go to Nairobi, Kenya and Karachi, Pakistan the most because that is where my mom's side and dad's side of the family live, respectively. </p>

  I can usually be found at a coffeeshop, somewhere outside on campus, or, from time-to-time, running around in Disney World. My favorite foods include pancakes and french fries (it's good, trust me) and pasta, and I could probably survive on cold brew coffee. The way to my heart is a classic chocolate milkshake or a random trip to Target!  </p>
