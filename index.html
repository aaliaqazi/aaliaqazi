  I am a sophomore at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in Supply Chain Management with a certificate in Business and Public Policy. Growing up in Houston, I lived with my parents, my older brother (and now my sister-in-law), and grandparents. My dad's side lives in Houston, so I hangout with my cousins often as well. My family and friends mean everything to me, and I love spending time with them :) </p>

  My favorite things to do are bingewatching TV shows on Netflix and going out to eat/trying new restaurants. Currently, my favorite place to eat is Main Chick, a hot chicken food truck chain. I've recently started cooking, so it has been fun to try new recipes and discover a new hobby! My favorite cuisines would definitely be Pakistani and Chinese, but my all time favorite foods are pancakes and french fries. I also enjoy traveling to new countries and learning about other people's cultures. I go to Nairobi, Kenya and Karachi, Pakistan the most because that is where my mom's side and dad's side of the family live, respectively. </p>

  My favorite website is Netflix because I started watching shows with my mom this past summer, which made me become even closer to her.
